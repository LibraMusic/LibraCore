  jwt_signing_key: secret # The secret key used to sign JWTs. In algorithms that use public/private keys, this should be the private key. Change this to a secure value. File paths are also supported with the format "file:<path>".
  jwt_refresh_token_expiration: 30d # Default is 30 days.
  jwt_access_token_expiration: 15m # Default is 15 minutes.
  global_api_routes_require_auth: true # Determines if "global" API routes (e.g., /api/v1/tracks) require authentication.
  user_api_routes_require_auth: true # Determines if "user" API routes (e.g., /api/v1/tracks/:id) require authentication.
  user_api_require_same_user: false # Determines if "user" API routes require that the authenticated user is the same as the user in the route. Disabled by default because enabling it disables song sharing and other interactions between users.
general:
  id_length: 7 # Adjust this value if there (somehow) aren't enough unique IDs. The calculation is 62^id_length, so a value of 7 gives 3.5 trillion unique IDs.

  video_audio_only: true # If true, only the audio of videos is downloaded and they are treated as tracks.
  inherit_listen_counts: false # If true, the listen count for newly added content is initially set to the listen count from the source. If false, the listen count is initially set to 0.
  artist_listen_counts_by_track: true # If true, the listen count for an artist is the sum of the listen counts for all of their content. If false, the listen count for an artist is the number of times a user has played the artist as a whole (i.e., pressing "Play" on the artist page).
